<i>The entire world
is a collection of memoranda</i>

3
00:00:38,966 --> 00:00:42,866
<i>that she did exist,
and that I have lost her.</i>

4
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:45,101
<i>Whatever our souls are made of,</i>

5
00:00:45,134 --> 00:00:47,732
<i>hers and mine are the same.</i>

6
00:00:48,067 --> 00:00:50,999
<i>A rather pretentious way
to open our story...</i>

7
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:53,632
<i>but I've always
had a flair for the dramatic.</i>

8
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:56,334
<i>You see, this is</i> our <i>story...</i>

9
00:00:56,366 --> 00:00:58,267
<i>Tessa's and mine.</i>

10
00:00:58,301 --> 00:01:00,134
<i>It's a story
you've heard before,</i>

11
00:01:00,167 --> 00:01:03,033
<i>passed down from the Greeks,
through Shakespeare,</i>

12
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:05,766
<i>the Brontes, Jane Austen.</i>

13
00:01:06,201 --> 00:01:09,799
<i>It's the story of a young girl
exploring her independence,</i>

14
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:12,766
<i>free from the bonds
of her oppressive parent...</i>

15
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,366
<i>and promised to a boy
she clearly does not love.</i>

16
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,833
<i>She meets a dashingly
handsome young man</i>

17
00:01:18,866 --> 00:01:21,101
<i>who sweeps her off her feet...</i>

18
00:01:21,134 --> 00:01:25,034
<i>even though he represents
everything she detests.</i>

19
00:01:25,067 --> 00:01:27,101
<i>She falls for him,</i>

20
00:01:27,134 --> 00:01:29,301
<i>gives herself to him,</i>

21
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:32,101
<i>and is ultimately
betrayed by him</i>

22
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:34,234
<i>and left shattered.</i>

23
00:01:34,866 --> 00:01:39,067
<i>Only it is he who is
destroyed by his deceit.</i>

24
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:42,000
<i>When it feels as though
all is lost,</i>

25
00:01:42,034 --> 00:01:46,267
<i>the two reunite
and live happily ever after.</i>

26
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,366
<i>Like I've said,
a story you've heard before.</i>

27
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,732
<i>Only difference is...</i>

28
00:01:52,966 --> 00:01:55,101

00:02:46,067 --> 00:02:48,333
- Piss off.
- I'm looking for someone.

37
00:02:48,366 --> 00:02:50,134

Whoo! Sure don't seem
like Christmas out here,

44
00:03:11,766 --> 00:03:13,866
all this heat we've been havin'.

45
00:03:13,899 --> 00:03:16,300
Ya know, I hate the heat.

46
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:19,266
Heat make people
do some crazy things.

47
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,699
Hoo!

48
00:03:33,134 --> 00:03:35,233
Thank... Thank you!

49
00:03:35,732 --> 00:03:37,833
Sorry.

50
00:03:40,866 --> 00:03:43,233
Excuse me! Sir, can you
hold that elevator, please!

51
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:45,366
Asswipe!

52
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,034
Thank you.

53
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,200
Did you call me an asswipe?

54
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:57,034
Excuse me?

55
00:03:57,067 --> 00:03:59,967
You just called me an asswipe.

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,067
Um, no. I didn't.

57
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:05,366
Yeah, I guess
I just imagined it.

58
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,699
Guess so.

59
00:04:08,034 --> 00:04:11,000
Ya know, I <i>was</i> trying
to hold the elevator for you.

60
00:04:11,034 --> 00:04:13,134
Sure you were.

61
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,000
Look, I'm sorry.
It's my first day.

62
00:04:18,034 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm just trying
to make an impression.

63
00:04:20,034 --> 00:04:23,799
Well, you certainly
succeeded at that.

64
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:27,666
Asswipe.

65
00:04:34,133 --> 00:04:35,300
No, no, no, no...

66
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,067
- You work here?
- Surprise.

67
00:04:37,101 --> 00:04:38,266
Tessa!

68
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,034
Welcome to Vance Publishing.

69
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:41,699
Hi. Kimberly, right?

70
00:04:41,732 --> 00:04:43,300
Excellent memory.
I'm impressed.

71
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,967
Yes, she makes
quite the impression.

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,900
You two know each other?

73
00:04:45,934 --> 00:04:48,233
Uh... we're old friends.

74
00:04:48,266 --> 00:04:50,699
Now, if you ladies
will excuse me?

75
00:04:50,732 --> 00:04:52,300
- Are you excited to get going?
- Yeah.

76
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,766
Let's introduce you to the boss.

77
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:58,034
Shut the fuck up
and listen to me!

78
00:04:58,067 --> 00:05:00,766
This might not be
the best time for introductions.

79
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,000
Why don't I
show you your office?

80
00:05:04,034 --> 00:05:05,934
Trevor!

81
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:08,067
On it.

82
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,166
I apologize for the mess.

83
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,834
We've been short
on interns lately,

84
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:17,300
and we're a bit backlogged.

85
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,967
That seems crazy to me.

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,100
People I know would kill
for an internship here.

87
00:05:21,133 --> 00:05:22,666
I know, it's just that Vance

88
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:24,732
has this small problem with

89
00:05:24,766 --> 00:05:26,133
firing them after a day.

90
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,421
But that's not
going to happen to you.

91
00:05:27,433 --> 00:05:29,366
I have a good feeling
about this.

92
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,834
But like I said
during the interview,

93
00:05:31,867 --> 00:05:33,666
your job is to read
five manuscripts a week,

94
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:36,000
and if you like them,
just forward them on to me.

95
00:05:36,034 --> 00:05:38,200
- Okay.
- The kitchen is right down the hall.

96
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:40,366
Feel free to place
any order for lunch.

97
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,867
- Any questions?
- Uh, no. I'm good.

98
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,100
You got this.

99
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,233
Mmm.

100
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,166
Mr. Vance!

101
00:06:46,967 --> 00:06:48,999
Um... Um, I'm so sorry.

102
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,400
I must have dozed off.

103
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:52,867
- What time is it?
- 9:25.

104
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:56,834
9:25?

105
00:06:56,867 --> 00:06:58,967
- Am I fired?
- Sit down.

106
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,867
You mean to tell me
you read three books

107
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,033
and did coverage
on all of them last night,

108
00:07:04,066 --> 00:07:08,733
and you think <i>Carnival of Light</i>
by Niko Tanaka is a great read?

109
00:07:08,767 --> 00:07:10,632
Yeah, it is. It's, uh,

110
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,066
she has a really original voice,

111
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,200
it's a lot like
an early Margaret Atwood,

112
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:15,822
<i>The Edible Woman,</i>

113
00:07:15,834 --> 00:07:19,033
- <i>Surfacing...</i>
- I'm coming down now.

114
00:07:19,533 --> 00:07:21,999
Grab your things.
Come with me.

115
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:24,133
Oh, shit.

116
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,999
Morning, Mr. Vance.

117
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,100
- Morning, sir.
- Mr. Vance, I was just...

118
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:35,233
I was wondering if we had time
to go back to...

119
00:07:35,266 --> 00:07:36,800
Get in.

120
00:07:36,834 --> 00:07:39,233
Because I have to get
my phone charger in at...

121
00:07:39,266 --> 00:07:41,966
Oh, we're closing the door!

122
00:07:43,433 --> 00:07:45,834
Little work tip.

123
00:07:45,867 --> 00:07:48,366
- Hmm?
- It helps if you don't wear the same clothes every day.

124
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,999
That, and showering.

125
00:07:53,433 --> 00:07:55,633
Um, where are we going?

126
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:57,366
There's a digital
publishing conference,

127
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,700
and I need to secure
some funding for my expansion.

128
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,867
Fuck off!

129
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:10,066
What part of "We're closed"
don't...

130
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,733
- Hi.
- You busy?

131
00:08:11,767 --> 00:08:13,700
Kind of in the middle
of something.

132
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:18,033
So, you know, why don't you
come back tomorrow?

133
00:08:18,066 --> 00:08:20,366
Or just come in right now.

134
00:08:25,233 --> 00:08:26,733
I'm good.

135
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:29,600
Come on, it'll ease the pain.

136
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:32,400
I like the pain.

137
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:36,667
Well, suit yourself,
you fuckin' masochist.

138
00:08:42,233 --> 00:08:44,133
Welcome back the Montgomery,
Mr. Vance.

139
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,066
I have your rooms ready for you.

140
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,767
We had a printer delivered
to Mr. Trevor Matthews' room.

141
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,899
Unfortunately, Ms.
Young's room wasn't ready,

142
00:08:50,933 --> 00:08:53,354
so we had her upgraded to a suite
with compliments of the management.

143
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,033
Has Mr. Jiang checked in yet?

144
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:56,767
I do believe he's at the bar.

145
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,999
Of course he is.

146
00:08:58,033 --> 00:09:00,200
So I get a printer
and you get a suite.

147
00:09:00,233 --> 00:09:01,667
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

148
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,333
Definitely.

149
00:09:03,366 --> 00:09:05,166
Hon', do you mind
taking Tessa shopping?

150
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,421
She needs something for tonight.

151
00:09:06,433 --> 00:09:08,733
I trust you.

152
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:11,999
Let's go have some fun.

153
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:16,133
Are you sure that I can get in?

154
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,166
Because I've never been
to a nightclub before.

155
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,166
But don't they check...?

156
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,834
You'll be with us.
It won't be a problem.

157
00:09:23,866 --> 00:09:26,366
Look, before we go outside,

158
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,366
I just wanted
to tell you something.

159
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,667
Okay.

160
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,800
Vance and I are...

161
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,800
more than co-workers.

162
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:36,833
Oh.

163
00:09:36,866 --> 00:09:39,899
It was strictly
a work thing for years,

164
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:41,667
especially after his wife died,

165
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,633
then I started helping out
with his son Smith,

166
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:48,066
and, well, love can
really take you by surprise.

167
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,133
Yes, it can.

168
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,333
- That's him?
- Mm-hmm.

169
00:09:55,366 --> 00:09:58,133
- Aw.
- He's the sweetest kid.

170
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:01,166
Ohh.

171
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,933
Can't wait for them to see you
in this dress tonight.

172
00:10:04,966 --> 00:10:07,066
Oh, shoot.

173
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:09,033
We forgot to buy you underwear.

174
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,999
But my clothes
are at the laundry.

175
00:10:11,033 --> 00:10:13,300
If I leave now,
I can run back to the mall...

176
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,933
Oh, no, no, no.
No. It's fine.

177
00:10:14,966 --> 00:10:17,066
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

178
00:10:17,568 --> 00:10:21,066
Okay, I guess
we're goin' commando, then.

179
00:10:27,033 --> 00:10:29,633
I can't believe I've been
at Vance for only a day.

180
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:33,100
Well, Hardin said we'd
be lucky to have you.

181
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:36,833
- You spoke to Hardin.
- No, Vance did.

182
00:10:36,866 --> 00:10:38,667
He didn't tell you?

183
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,200
Must have slipped his mind.

184
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:17,866
Yes, well, as long as we're
at the conference by two...

185
00:11:20,434 --> 00:11:22,266
Wow.

186
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,568
You clean up nicely.

187
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,766
Gee, Trevor, you sure know
how to charm the ladies.

188
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:29,266
Tessa, you look stunning.

189
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,166
Thank you.

190
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,300
On the move.

191
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,166
So what books have you written?

192
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,300
Oh, this and that.

193
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,100
Feel like I'm sitting
at the kids' table.

194
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,766
Thanks.

195
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:00,933
No, that's not what I meant.
Sorry.

196
00:12:00,966 --> 00:12:02,300
I hate nightclubs.

197
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,401
Probably because
I suck at dancing.

198
00:12:04,434 --> 00:12:06,799
I love Ohio football,
but I hate nightclubs.

199
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,933
Why are we here?

200
00:12:09,866 --> 00:12:11,366
Him.

201
00:12:11,401 --> 00:12:13,367
Mr. Jiang.

202
00:12:13,401 --> 00:12:15,966
His family owns
a hedge fund worth 800 million

203
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:19,401
and it's considering
investing in Vance's expansion.

204
00:12:19,434 --> 00:12:20,766
You want me to get you a drink?

205
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:22,233
I'm gonna stick with water.

206
00:12:22,266 --> 00:12:24,333
All my budget
really allows these days.

207
00:12:24,367 --> 00:12:26,367
I thought you were
a paid intern.

208
00:12:26,401 --> 00:12:29,333
You'd be surprised how much
Uber charges can add up.

209
00:12:29,367 --> 00:12:31,766
I mean, I'd be lucky
to break even.

210
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,033
- I'll go.
- What it is?

211
00:12:39,434 --> 00:12:41,732
Sex on the Beach.

212
00:12:42,434 --> 00:12:43,899
Quite a beach.

213
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,999
Grab a straw.
On your mark, get set, go.

214
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,632
It's really good.

215
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,921
Mr. Jiang, have you had a chance
to look at my numbers yet?

216
00:13:00,933 --> 00:13:02,799
With the forecast of
rising interest rates...

217
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,200
Again. Just...

218
00:13:05,233 --> 00:13:07,334
Yeah.

219
00:13:10,033 --> 00:13:12,833
We're gonna
get fucked up tonight!

220
00:13:12,866 --> 00:13:14,334
<i>♪ I arrive for the women ♪</i>

221
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,166
<i>♪ I survive through the crimes ♪</i>

222

<i>♪ As the devil

223
00:13:30,266 --> 00:13:33,100
Well, well, look what
the cat dragged in.

224
00:13:33,133 --> 00:13:35,033
That's a stupid
fucking expression.

225
00:13:35,066 --> 00:13:37,266
Why would a cat
drag me anywhere?

226
00:13:37,301 --> 00:13:39,599
Welcome back, bro.

227
00:13:43,066 --> 00:13:45,166
Did you miss us?

228
00:13:53,534 --> 00:13:55,866
Wait.
I don't get it.

229
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:57,999
Of course you don't.

230
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:00,999
This is great!

231
00:14:04,033 --> 00:14:06,866
I feel like dancing!

232
00:14:15,866 --> 00:14:17,401
Guess who.

233
00:14:17,434 --> 00:14:18,966
Okay, I'll give you a hint.

234
00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:21,267
She's super fuckin' hot,
a lot of fun,

235
00:14:21,301 --> 00:14:23,233
and <i>loves</i> to fuck.

236
00:14:23,267 --> 00:14:25,732
- Mother Teresa.
- No. Ew.

237
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,301
Ta-da!

238
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:31,367
I know, I look amazing.
I've had, like, no carbs in eight weeks,

239
00:14:31,401 --> 00:14:33,367
- but I'm feeling fucking fantastic.
- Wow.

240
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:35,322
Yeah, its from the lack of
carbs and not all the blow.

241
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:36,787
Don't you have some carpets
to munch on?

242
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,079
Don't you have
some dick to suck?

243
00:15:41,234 --> 00:15:44,666
What do I have to do
to make you forgive me?

244
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:47,666
- I know I've been really bad.
- Worse than bad.

245
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:50,334
Yeah, but you like it
when I'm bad.

246
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,666
You know you miss me.

247
00:15:56,732 --> 00:15:58,833
Now get the fuck off me.

248
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:01,267
Whoa!

249
00:16:01,301 --> 00:16:03,699
What the fuck, Hardin?!

250
00:16:04,201 --> 00:16:06,322
Hardin, you didn't mind fucking me
before, though, right?

251
00:16:06,334 --> 00:16:08,632
Oh, let me guess.

252
00:16:08,966 --> 00:16:11,167
You're still moping
over that stuck-up bitch.

253
00:16:11,201 --> 00:16:12,833
Don't fuckin' talk about her,
okay?!

254
00:16:12,866 --> 00:16:15,666
Look at you. You look
like a lost little puppy

255
00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:17,367
over some
Virgin Mary-turned-skank

256
00:16:17,401 --> 00:16:21,367
who doesn't even want you!

257
00:16:21,401 --> 00:16:23,699
Ohhh, God.

258
00:16:23,966 --> 00:16:26,334
What the fuck you looking at,
freshman?

259
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:31,234
You want me to steal your boyfriend?
So turn the fuck around.

260
00:16:31,267 --> 00:16:33,367
I look hot.

261
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:45,101
Tessa?

262
00:16:45,134 --> 00:16:46,866
Hi! I just, uh,

263
00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:48,267
I just wanted to inform you

264
00:16:48,301 --> 00:16:50,367
that I look hot,

265
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,933
and you're missing it.

266
00:16:51,966 --> 00:16:54,033
Tessa, where are you?

267
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:55,933
Whoo! Somewhere that you're not.

268
00:16:55,966 --> 00:16:58,766
Tess, I have your location,
I can find you.

269
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:01,301
♪ How much have you had to drink?

270
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:03,334
I don't know, like five?

271
00:17:03,367 --> 00:17:04,367
Five what?

272
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,732
Uh, Sex on the Beaches.

273
00:17:07,367 --> 00:17:10,134
Or is it Sexes on the Beaches?

274
00:17:10,766 --> 00:17:13,067
That coulda been fun!

275
00:17:13,101 --> 00:17:14,833
You are wasted.

276
00:17:14,866 --> 00:17:17,134
Oh, hey, Hardin?
I'm the commander.

277
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:19,400
<i>I've been the commander
all night.</i>

278
00:17:19,433 --> 00:17:21,101
Command...

279
00:17:21,134 --> 00:17:22,732
<i>What's it called?</i>

280
00:17:22,766 --> 00:17:25,666
I'm not wearing any underwear!

281
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:27,799
- <i>Aaah! Ha ha ha!</i>
- Tess, who are you with?

282
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,799
Why haven't you called me?

283
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,134
I've texted you a hundred times!

284
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:32,334
You haven't replied!

285
00:17:32,366 --> 00:17:34,234
I actually have to go,

286
00:17:34,267 --> 00:17:36,866
but it was nice talking to
you, Mr. Hardin Scott,

287
00:17:36,899 --> 00:17:38,234
so goodbye.

288
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:41,599
Don't fu... Te...

289
00:17:42,101 --> 00:17:43,334
Tessa.

290
00:17:43,366 --> 00:17:45,366
Trevor!

291
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,101
I'm drunk, uncomfortable,
and I saw a tampon on the ground.

292
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:49,799
- I'm leaving.
- Yeah, no, me too.

293
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,301
Can we order room service?

294
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,666
I... I want French fries

295
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,666
and... ice cream.

296
00:17:56,699 --> 00:17:58,799
Dow!

297
00:18:00,999 --> 00:18:03,799
Nothin' like a vanilla sundae
at three in the morning.

298
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,067
Yeah,
it sounded better in the moment.

299
00:18:08,234 --> 00:18:10,632
- So... Tessa.
- Hmm.

300
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,366
- Tessa Young.
- Mm-hmm.

301
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,666
Why the hell
are you in publishing?

302
00:18:14,699 --> 00:18:16,833
Well, I love to read...

303
00:18:18,067 --> 00:18:20,167
That makes sense.

304
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,799
What's your favorite book?

305
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:26,933
It's <i>The Principles of
Economics</i> by Alfred Marshall.

306
00:18:26,966 --> 00:18:28,899
- No, it's not.
- Yeah, it is.

307
00:18:28,933 --> 00:18:31,034
No, I mean...
I mean, like, fiction.

308
00:18:31,067 --> 00:18:33,034
Like... Like a real book.

309
00:18:33,067 --> 00:18:35,034
I don't do fiction.

310
00:18:35,067 --> 00:18:36,833
I mean, have you seen
how I dress?

311
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,366
- You heathen!
- Heathen?

312
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,134
You heathen!

313
00:18:40,167 --> 00:18:42,400
Fiction's an escape
from reality,

314
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:44,388
it's a way that, like,
you can live a hundred lives,

315
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,933
or even a thousand.

316
00:18:45,966 --> 00:18:47,699
I don't need to live
a thousand lives.

317
00:18:47,732 --> 00:18:51,599
Okay? And I would rather
watch paint dry.

318
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,266
I, um, that wasn't...

319
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,732
No, I... that wasn't
supposed to happen.

320
00:19:10,933 --> 00:19:12,866
Look, I'm telling you,
I know what I'm doing.

321
00:19:12,899 --> 00:19:16,666
We just have to soak it
before it stains.

322
00:19:17,899 --> 00:19:19,266
Can I have your pants?

323
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,234
- Tessa...
- Gimme your pants!

324
00:19:21,266 --> 00:19:24,034
Otherwise it's gonna stain.

325
00:19:31,201 --> 00:19:33,632
<i>Tessa!</i>

326
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,321
- <i>Tessa, open the door.</i>
- Is that Hardin Scott?

327
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:38,034
<i>Open the door!</i>

328
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,134
Hi.

329
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:46,833
Are you trying to get me
kicked out of this place?

330
00:19:46,866 --> 00:19:49,699
Yeah,
come on in, why don't you?

331
00:19:49,732 --> 00:19:51,833
Hey...

332
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,034
Hey, Hardin, didn't see ya.
How ya been?

333
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:57,732
- Fucking Trevor?!
- Time to go, I think.

334
00:19:57,766 --> 00:19:59,155
- I'm just gonna...
- No, you're not.

335
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:01,134
- I just wanna talk to him!
- No! No...

336
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:03,034
- Tessa... Tessa...
- Stop!

337
00:20:03,067 --> 00:20:05,632
- Hardin, I think this is a mis...
- Fuck off.

338
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,799
You're such a dick.
Why are you even here?

339
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,366
<i>I'm</i> a dick?

340
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,732
I'm not the one taking
advantage of drunk girls.

341
00:20:11,766 --> 00:20:13,699
You... You do know
that not every guy

342
00:20:13,732 --> 00:20:16,034
is trying to get
in my pants, right?

343
00:20:16,067 --> 00:20:18,266
- You'd be surprised.
- You can't tell me

344
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,955
who I can and can't have sex with,
because it's none of your business anymore!

345
00:20:20,967 --> 00:20:23,632
- Were you going to have sex with him?
- Oh, my God!

346
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:24,934
- What?
- You're insane!

347
00:20:24,967 --> 00:20:27,934
You're avoiding the question.

348
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,233
What if I was?

349
00:20:35,266 --> 00:20:37,366
What?

350
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,934
You heard me.

351
00:20:41,766 --> 00:20:44,000
What if I was?

352
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,233
What, you don't like that?

353
00:20:46,266 --> 00:20:49,200
You don't like the idea
of Trevor's hands...

354
00:20:49,233 --> 00:20:51,300
all over my body?

355
00:20:52,034 --> 00:20:54,134
Touching me?

356
00:20:58,732 --> 00:21:00,799
I've missed this.

357
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:04,134
- Tessa, you're drunk.
- Mm-hmm. So?

358
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,666
Tess...

359
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:09,000
Hmm!

360
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:10,233
You don't want this?

361
00:21:10,266 --> 00:21:13,034
Of course I want this, but I...

362
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:16,900
Hardin... you have
two options here.

363
00:21:18,366 --> 00:21:20,632
Either you fuck me,

364
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,867
or you leave.

365
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,967
You decide.

366
00:21:50,967 --> 00:21:53,067
Ohh.

367
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,166
- Do you have a condom?
- Are you sure?

368
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,200
- Why not.
- You'll hate me tomorrow.

369
00:22:03,233 --> 00:22:06,200
Yeah, well, I hate you already.

370
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,666
Tell me I'm the only one.

371
00:22:22,699 --> 00:22:24,732
You're the only one.

372
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,100
Mmm.

373
00:23:04,834 --> 00:23:06,100
- Hi!
<i>- Morning!</i>

374
00:23:06,133 --> 00:23:07,867
- Kimberly!
- <i>You up?</i>

375
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,388
Yeah... no, yeah,
I've been up for a while.

376
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,133
- <i>See you down in five.</i>
- Five minutes?

377
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:13,066
- <i>Problem?</i>
- Nope, not a problem.

378
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,054
- <i>Meet you in the lobby.</i>
- Okay, I'll be right down.

379
00:23:15,066 --> 00:23:17,767
- <i>Don't be late.</i>
- Okay. Bye.

380
00:23:18,834 --> 00:23:20,934
Shit!

381
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,934
Where are my clothes?!

382
00:23:32,133 --> 00:23:34,233
Ohh!

383
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,900
Tessa!

384
00:23:37,934 --> 00:23:40,033
Come back to bed.

385
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,100
Tessa!

386
00:23:43,133 --> 00:23:45,632
What?!
What do you want?!

387
00:23:46,066 --> 00:23:49,033
The other Tessa.
The one who's nice?

388
00:23:49,066 --> 00:23:52,100
Yeah, well, she's late for work.

389
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,066
- Where are my...
- Why are you so...

390
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,200
Hey! Privacy!

391
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:03,133
Privacy.
After what we did last night,

392
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:04,300
you want privacy?

393
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:05,667
Don't remind me.

394
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,400
Hey, you called <i>me.</i>

395
00:24:07,433 --> 00:24:09,733
I didn't tell you to come here.

396
00:24:09,767 --> 00:24:11,800
Okay, I'm starting
to get the feeling

397
00:24:11,834 --> 00:24:13,922
you're not entirely cool
with what happened last night.

398
00:24:13,934 --> 00:24:15,233
No, I'm not cool with it.

399
00:24:15,266 --> 00:24:16,867
Well, do you want
to talk about it?

400
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,966
Nope. You hurt me
and I can't forgive you.

401
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,679
- That's it.
- So last night meant nothing.

402
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,999
I was drunk.

403
00:24:22,033 --> 00:24:24,900
I called you, you came here...

404
00:24:25,867 --> 00:24:26,999
I made a mistake.

405
00:24:27,033 --> 00:24:28,700
But you obviously missed me.

406
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:30,733
I didn't know what I was doing.

407
00:24:30,767 --> 00:24:32,266
- From kissing that guy, to...
- What?

408
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,100
- What?
- From kissing?

409
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:35,900
- What did you say?
- I didn't say anything.

410
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,633
- You said "kissing that guy."
- No.

411
00:24:37,667 --> 00:24:39,300
- What?! T...
- I need to go.

412
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:41,300
Tessa, wait. Tessa!

413
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:44,066
Tessa!

414
00:24:44,933 --> 00:24:47,033
Put your clothes on!

415
00:24:48,133 --> 00:24:50,300
- Who did you kiss?
- No one!

416
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:51,700
- Was it Trevor?
- No!

417
00:24:51,733 --> 00:24:53,066
My Tessa would never

418
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,633
kiss a fuckin' stranger
at a club.

419
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:56,800
There is no "your Tessa"
anymore!

420
00:24:56,834 --> 00:25:02,800
Yeah, well, when you were kissing that
guy, I was fucking Molly.

421
00:25:05,366 --> 00:25:07,667
Fuck you!

422
00:25:12,233 --> 00:25:14,333
Fuck!

423
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:21,633
- Oh!
- Sorry.

424
00:25:23,133 --> 00:25:25,233
Hi.

425
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,767
- Hi.
- Got us some lattes.

426
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,266
Thank you.

427
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,667
Oh. Thank you.

428
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,066
So, interesting night.

429
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,999
Trevor, I'm... so sorry
about last night.

430
00:25:40,033 --> 00:25:42,633
No, don't be. If I showed up
to my girlfriend's hotel room

431
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:45,366
and I saw a half-naked,
incredibly handsome man there,

432
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,767
I'd react the same way.

433
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,733
Is he still lurking around?

434
00:25:48,767 --> 00:25:50,899
Should I be hiding in the van?

435
00:25:50,933 --> 00:25:52,633
He's the one that
should be hiding,

436
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:54,899
and we are not together.

437
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,133
How do you two know each other?

438
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:02,333
- Hardin worked at Vance last year.
- He did?

439
00:26:02,366 --> 00:26:04,866
Yeah. Same position as you,
actually.

440
00:26:04,899 --> 00:26:06,366
Kind of a sad story.

441
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,300
We were best of friends, and...

442
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:11,133
then we became lovers,

443
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:14,300
and then I found
a red hair on my pillow.

444
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:16,633
Hilarious.

445
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,388
Ya know, I didn't peg you
as the bad boy type.

446
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,733
We'll save that
for another time.

447
00:26:22,366 --> 00:26:24,400
My hero. Ohh.

448
00:26:24,433 --> 00:26:26,700
Anyone else feel like death?

449
00:26:26,733 --> 00:26:29,633
I don't know what you two said
or did to Neil last night,

450
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:32,366
but he just wrote a humongous
check to finance our expansion.

451
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,700
Good job.

452
00:26:47,033 --> 00:26:48,700
What are you doing here?

453
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:50,733
I need some advice.

454
00:26:50,767 --> 00:26:52,200
Advice?

455
00:26:52,233 --> 00:26:54,066
You want advice from me?

456
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,866
Yeah.

457
00:26:55,899 --> 00:26:57,333
I'm that desperate.

458
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,633
Oh, insults. Great.

459
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:01,799
I thought you were
an imposter for a second.

460
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:04,366
- Look, bro, I know I-
- No, step-bro.

461
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,333
I'm not your brother.
You made that very clear.

462
00:27:07,366 --> 00:27:09,833
And if I was Tessa,
I'd never speak to you again, Hardin.

463
00:27:09,866 --> 00:27:12,766
- It's unforgiveable.
- You think I don't know that?!

464
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,766
I know I fucked up!
I know!

465
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,866
She won't return my calls
or texts.

466
00:27:17,899 --> 00:27:20,033
I found out she kissed some guy.

467
00:27:20,066 --> 00:27:22,667
And... And I told her
I fucked Molly.

468
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,966
- You slept with Molly?
- No, I <i>said</i> I did.

469
00:27:24,999 --> 00:27:26,667
That's the point.
I didn't.

470
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,166
I said it to get back at her,

471
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,733
and I-I realized
how stupid that was.

472
00:27:30,766 --> 00:27:32,799
- Yeah.
- Oh, fuck this!

473
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:36,333
So you're just gonna run away like
you do from everything. Right?

474
00:27:36,366 --> 00:27:38,766
- Where you goin'?
- London.

475
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,966
I was going to take her with me.

476
00:27:40,999 --> 00:27:42,799
I'll see you next year.

477
00:27:42,833 --> 00:27:45,833
Hardin, do you really love her?

478
00:27:45,866 --> 00:27:47,966
No bullshit.

479
00:27:48,999 --> 00:27:50,333
Yes.

480
00:27:50,366 --> 00:27:52,100
Of course I fucking love her.

481
00:27:52,133 --> 00:27:55,366
I've never felt this way
about anyone before!

482
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,166
Just wish I didn't
fuck the whole thing up.

483
00:28:35,401 --> 00:28:37,699
Focus.

484
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:40,667
Knock knock.

485
00:28:40,699 --> 00:28:42,333
- Hi.
- Hi.

486
00:28:42,366 --> 00:28:44,667
You're probably goin'
out of town for break,

487
00:28:44,699 --> 00:28:47,233
so just wanna say happy
holidays, and a happy birthday.

488
00:28:47,266 --> 00:28:50,033
- It's your birthday, right?
- Tomorrow.

489
00:28:50,066 --> 00:28:52,166
I made you something.

490
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:56,333
What's... What's this?

491
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:59,833
It is a cost analysis breakdown

492
00:28:59,866 --> 00:29:01,666
of your weekly Uber expenditure

493
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:03,999
versus owning a used car.

494
00:29:04,666 --> 00:29:06,633
Okay...

495
00:29:06,666 --> 00:29:09,999
I know. It's just,
turns out you're wasting a lot of money.

496
00:29:10,033 --> 00:29:13,799
I did a little research,
and I found a 2013 Toyota Corolla,

497
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:15,799
in town, in excellent condition.

498
00:29:15,833 --> 00:29:18,732
I went down to the dealership,
negotiated terms,

499
00:29:18,766 --> 00:29:22,233
and you'd put no money down,
you only pay 150 bucks a month.

500
00:29:22,266 --> 00:29:25,166
Vance also agreed to put your
auto insurance on company policy,

501
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,799
so that's free.

502
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:28,666
This is, of course,
if you want to do it.

503
00:29:28,699 --> 00:29:29,720
I just like crunching numbers...

504
00:29:29,732 --> 00:29:31,066
Oh, my God!

505
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,100
- I take it you...
- Oh, my God! Mwah!

506
00:29:33,133 --> 00:29:35,233
Thank you.

507
00:29:38,033 --> 00:29:39,899
Bye, Tessa.

508
00:29:44,899 --> 00:29:47,334
So, what do you think?

509
00:29:47,367 --> 00:29:49,401
Well, you know,

510
00:29:49,434 --> 00:29:51,066
it's, uh...

511
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,866
it's very Tessa.

512
00:29:52,899 --> 00:29:54,833
I will take that
as a compliment.

513
00:29:54,866 --> 00:29:56,966
I'm right up there.

514
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,133
How's Dakota?

515
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:05,133
Um, I'm actually looking
at your birthday horoscope.

516
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:09,066
So first off,
you share a birthday with...

517
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,599
- Joseph Stalin.
- Great.

518
00:30:12,266 --> 00:30:15,899
- You are a proud, idealistic person...
- Like Stalin.

519
00:30:15,933 --> 00:30:19,066
You are more emotional
than is obvious.

520
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:23,033
You may solidify
a romantic relationship

521
00:30:23,066 --> 00:30:27,266
or become involved
with a mature partner.

522
00:30:27,301 --> 00:30:29,401
Mature.
That doesn't really sound...

523
00:30:29,434 --> 00:30:31,833
No, it doesn't.

524
00:30:31,866 --> 00:30:33,267
He left for London.

525
00:30:33,301 --> 00:30:35,732
Have you heard from him?

526
00:30:36,133 --> 00:30:38,301
I haven't,
because I blocked him.

527
00:30:38,334 --> 00:30:40,632
That'll work.

528
00:30:42,367 --> 00:30:44,666
Bye.

529
00:31:21,334 --> 00:31:25,033
<i>Whose place is this?</i>

530
00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:46,134
<i>"You can draw me to fire,</i>

531
00:32:46,167 --> 00:32:48,100
<i>"you can draw me to water.</i>

532
00:32:48,134 --> 00:32:50,666
<i>"You can draw me to the gallows,</i>

533
00:32:50,699 --> 00:32:53,267
<i>you can draw me to any death."</i>

534
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:29,699
Well, here we are.
I could run you a bath

535
00:33:29,732 --> 00:33:31,212
if you'd like to get
more comfortable.

536
00:33:31,234 --> 00:33:33,066
I would love that.

537
00:33:33,101 --> 00:33:38,066
I remember when you and I
used to take baths together.

538
00:33:39,433 --> 00:33:41,367
Oh, my goodness! Tessa?

539
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,666
- Tessa.
- Hardin's mother.

540
00:33:43,699 --> 00:33:45,054
Hardin said you were
gonna be out of town,

541
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:46,933
I didn't think
I was gonna meet you!

542
00:33:46,966 --> 00:33:48,632
- Yeah.
- My God,

543
00:33:48,666 --> 00:33:50,400
I cannot believe
how pretty you are.

544
00:33:50,433 --> 00:33:52,289
I mean, Hardin said you were the
most beautiful girl in the world,

545
00:33:52,301 --> 00:33:55,400
but honestly, I thought you were
gonna be covered in tattoos,

546
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:57,366
green hair,
and a piercing on your bean.

547
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,933
- What bean?
- Mum.

548
00:33:58,966 --> 00:34:00,400
Don't be so melodramatic,
Hardin.

549
00:34:00,433 --> 00:34:02,134
You and I are gonna
be the best of friends.

550
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:03,732
Do you mind if I use the loo?

551
00:34:03,766 --> 00:34:05,301
Yeah, of course.
It's just, um...

552
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:07,632
Oh, look at you!

553
00:34:09,067 --> 00:34:11,354
- Why are you here?
- I came to get the rest of my stuff.

554
00:34:11,366 --> 00:34:13,155
- You were supposed to be in London.
- I know.

555
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:14,921
I didn't want to go without
you, so she came here.

556
00:34:14,933 --> 00:34:16,866
Why didn't you tell her
that we broke up?

557
00:34:16,899 --> 00:34:18,899
She was so excited
when I told her first,

558
00:34:18,933 --> 00:34:20,388
- I couldn't ruin it for her.
- Hardin!

559
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,067
She's my mum!
I couldn't tell her

560
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,167
about the stupid bet, okay?
I'm sorry.

561
00:34:24,201 --> 00:34:28,699
I don't expect you
to pretend we're still together.

562
00:34:28,732 --> 00:34:31,067
- It's fine.
- What's fine?

563
00:34:31,101 --> 00:34:34,234
I said it's fine.
I'll play along.

564
00:34:34,267 --> 00:34:36,400
Thank you, Tessa.
Thank you so much.

565
00:34:36,433 --> 00:34:38,167
Thanks for the Kindle.

566
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,333
Fuck! Happy birthday!

567
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:42,866
- Is it your birthday?
- Yeah, it is.

568
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:44,766
Why are we not celebrating?

569
00:34:44,799 --> 00:34:47,766
'Cause I... I was just about
to head out of town.

570
00:34:47,799 --> 00:34:50,167
- No!
- Yeah, I'm gonna see my mom.

571
00:34:50,201 --> 00:34:54,866
Can I be selfish and ask
you to stay another night?

572
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:58,267
Well, my mom's sort of expec...

573
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,666
We don't know when we're
gonna see each other again.

574
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:04,699
Yeah. I, uh, I...
I guess I can leave tomorrow.

575
00:35:04,732 --> 00:35:06,833
Brilliant, brilliant,
brilliant.

576
00:35:06,866 --> 00:35:10,799
I am gonna whip you up a homemade birthday
cake that is gonna blow your mind.

577
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:12,167
Cool.

578
00:35:12,201 --> 00:35:13,766
Cool.

579
00:35:20,167 --> 00:35:22,101
I know I'm biased
'cause I'm his mum,

580
00:35:22,134 --> 00:35:25,000
but isn't that just the cutest
little bum you've ever seen?

581
00:35:25,034 --> 00:35:26,766
Oh, my God, Mum, please.

582
00:35:26,799 --> 00:35:28,699
- Hush.
- It's a pretty cute bum,

583
00:35:28,732 --> 00:35:30,699
Hardin.

584
00:35:30,732 --> 00:35:32,000
Right. Well, uh,

585
00:35:32,034 --> 00:35:33,799
you guys are obviously
having lots of fun,

586
00:35:33,833 --> 00:35:36,134
so I'm just gonna clear up,

587
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:39,266
and then... set myself on fire.

588
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,899
So Hardin tells me you're
an English major as well.

589
00:35:41,933 --> 00:35:45,400
Mm-hmm. I'm in the process
of switching from econ.

590
00:35:45,433 --> 00:35:49,766
I actually just got an
internship at Vance Publishing.

591
00:35:49,799 --> 00:35:51,899
Vance, as in... Christian Vance?

592
00:35:51,933 --> 00:35:54,034
Mm-hmm.

593
00:35:55,134 --> 00:35:58,034
Hardin and I stayed with
Vance for a few years

594
00:35:58,067 --> 00:35:59,766
when Ken and I broke up.

595
00:35:59,799 --> 00:36:01,899
- Really?
- Yeah.

596
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:04,266
Hardin never mentioned that.

597
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,799
Never mentioned what?

598
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:08,333
Nothing, darling.
Just girl talk.

599
00:36:37,034 --> 00:36:40,200
I'm just gonna grab a blanket
and sleep on the floor.

600
00:36:40,233 --> 00:36:44,366
You don't think we could
share the bed and not...

601
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,799
- You know.
- Do you?

602
00:36:46,833 --> 00:36:48,699
Well, I'd <i>like</i> to think

603
00:36:48,732 --> 00:36:52,034
that we're not
total Neanderthals.

604
00:36:52,666 --> 00:36:54,766
Okay.

605
00:37:00,934 --> 00:37:02,799
G'night.

606
00:37:02,833 --> 00:37:04,934
Good night.

607
00:37:13,266 --> 00:37:15,366
Um...

608
00:37:16,034 --> 00:37:19,732
I'm gonna leave
early in the morning

609
00:37:20,134 --> 00:37:22,266
to... to head out of town.

610
00:37:26,732 --> 00:37:28,833
Okay.

611
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,967
Thank you for staying tonight.

612
00:37:34,134 --> 00:37:36,266
Thanks for having me.

613
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,333
Sorry.

614
00:37:44,366 --> 00:37:47,067
No. No, it's...
That's okay.

615
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,967
That feels nice.

616
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,000
- Does it?
- Mm-hmm.

617
00:38:24,133 --> 00:38:27,133
- Did you have a nice birthday?
- Yeah, I did.

618
00:38:27,166 --> 00:38:30,867
And thank you again
for the... gift,

619
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,266
it was really thoughtful.

620
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,133
I found it when I was
getting my stuff.

621
00:38:35,166 --> 00:38:37,233
I'm glad you like it.

622
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,800
I love it.

623
00:38:49,533 --> 00:38:51,834
I got a car.

624
00:38:52,233 --> 00:38:54,666
- You got a car?
- Mm-hmm.

625
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,599
What car did you get?

626
00:39:01,166 --> 00:39:03,266
A white one.

627
00:39:05,266 --> 00:39:07,599
Well, happy birthday.

628
00:39:10,066 --> 00:39:12,166
Night.

629
00:39:16,133 --> 00:39:18,233
Good night.

630
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,900
- Good night.
- Good night.

631
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,900
Good night.

632
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,599
- Hardin.
- Huh?

633
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,100
This isn't working.

634
00:39:46,366 --> 00:39:48,666
Why? What's wrong?

635
00:39:49,934 --> 00:39:52,033
Feel.

636
00:39:55,967 --> 00:39:58,066
Oh.

637
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,800
You?

638
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:10,133
Oh.

639
00:40:28,934 --> 00:40:31,166
Hardin, we should stop.

640
00:40:31,934 --> 00:40:34,033
Okay.

641
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:35,421
Three seconds and we'll stop.

642
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,733
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

643
00:40:39,733 --> 00:40:41,999
- Three...
- Three...

644
00:40:42,033 --> 00:40:44,100
- two...
- two...

645
00:40:44,834 --> 00:40:46,900
- one.
- One.

646
00:40:54,366 --> 00:40:56,800
- Okay, ten more seconds.
- Okay.

647
00:40:56,834 --> 00:40:58,667
- And then we'll stop.
- Okay.

648
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,800
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

649
00:41:05,066 --> 00:41:08,633
Will you apologize to your mum
for us kidnapping you last night?

650
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:10,733
I will.

651
00:41:11,933 --> 00:41:15,834
I can't tell you how much it means
to me to see Hardin this way.

652
00:41:15,867 --> 00:41:17,999
What way?

653
00:41:18,033 --> 00:41:20,133
Happy.

654
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,633
What?

655
00:41:26,133 --> 00:41:28,233
- Bye.
- Bye.

- Vroom vroom!
- Noah, hi!

668
00:41:59,999 --> 00:42:01,300
- Hi!
- It's good to see you!

669
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:02,767
Good to see you too.

670
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,100
Mmm.

671
00:42:04,133 --> 00:42:06,233
Okay...

672
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:09,921
Your mom told me that you were comin' home
today, so I figured I'd come greet you.

673
00:42:09,933 --> 00:42:11,866
Did she have you on speed dial

674
00:42:11,899 --> 00:42:13,733
the second I crossed
the county line?

675
00:42:13,767 --> 00:42:15,133
I mean,
can you blame her?

676
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:16,999
She knows a good thing
when she sees it.

677
00:42:17,033 --> 00:42:18,633
- Right.
- Right.

678
00:42:18,667 --> 00:42:20,333
Um, how's senior year?

679
00:42:20,366 --> 00:42:23,033
You know me,
breakin' hearts and takin' names.

680
00:42:23,066 --> 00:42:25,667
- That's you.
- Yeah? Yeah.

681
00:42:25,966 --> 00:42:28,133
Your mom told me
about the internship.

682
00:42:28,166 --> 00:42:30,400
- That's really awesome.
- Thanks. Yeah.

683
00:42:30,433 --> 00:42:32,899
And everything's cool with
the whole thing with your dad.

684
00:42:32,933 --> 00:42:34,834
- What whole thing with my dad?
- What?

685
00:42:34,866 --> 00:42:36,366
N-Nothing. Nothing.

686
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,300
- What do you mean, nothing?
- I-I don't know.

687
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:42,033
- I thought that she would have...
- Thought she what?

688
00:42:42,066 --> 00:42:44,767
Uh...

689
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,233
Are you kidding?

690
00:42:47,266 --> 00:42:49,866
- Why is she calling you?
- I'm sorry, Tess.

691
00:42:49,899 --> 00:42:51,700
<i>Sorry,
I got stuck at work.</i>

692
00:42:51,733 --> 00:42:53,266
- Is she there yet?
- Mom?

693
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,400
- Carol, she knows!
- Knows what?!

694
00:42:55,433 --> 00:42:57,066
Oh! Tessa's with you.

695
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,633
I hope I'm not interrupting
anything.

696
00:42:58,667 --> 00:42:59,933
What is going on with Dad?!

697
00:42:59,966 --> 00:43:02,033
Okay, that was rude.

698
00:43:02,933 --> 00:43:04,400
I'm just asking you about Dad.

699
00:43:04,433 --> 00:43:05,899
<i>Fine.</i>

700
00:43:05,933 --> 00:43:07,366
Your father wanted to see you,

701
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,700
but I chased him off.

702
00:43:09,733 --> 00:43:11,633
Why are you getting
so worked up about this?

703
00:43:11,667 --> 00:43:13,366
I'm not getting worked up!

704
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,421
I just don't understand why
you'd keep that a secret.

705
00:43:15,433 --> 00:43:19,066
And you never kept
any secrets from me?

706
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:22,200
<i>Because I can think of
a big one, and so can Noah.</i>

707
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:24,233
I thought we got past
this little hiccup

708
00:43:24,266 --> 00:43:26,200
once you got your heart broken.

709
00:43:26,233 --> 00:43:28,100
<i>But I can tell by
the sound of your voice</i>

710
00:43:28,133 --> 00:43:29,866
<i>that this not the case.</i>

711
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:32,200
This boy is not good for you,
Teresa.

712
00:43:32,233 --> 00:43:34,966
- <i>He is just like your father.</i>
- I'm hanging up.

713
00:43:34,999 --> 00:43:38,100
- <i>No! Don't you fucking hang up on me!</i>
- This was a mistake.

714
00:43:38,133 --> 00:43:40,233
<i>Theresa? Theresa?</i>

715
00:43:40,999 --> 00:43:42,866
I blew it.

716
00:43:42,899 --> 00:43:44,667
I blew it, Carol.
I don't know what happened.

717
00:44:14,266 --> 00:44:16,233
Mummy?

718
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:27,667
No!

719
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:28,833
Mummy?

720
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:31,866
Hardin, get back upstairs now!

721
00:44:33,667 --> 00:44:35,166
Hey. Hey, I'm right here.

722
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,300
Hey. Hey.

723
00:44:39,033 --> 00:44:40,899
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

724
00:44:42,166 --> 00:44:44,600
It was just a nightmare.

725
00:44:56,799 --> 00:44:58,100
Morning.

726
00:44:58,133 --> 00:45:01,233
There... um, there's tea.
I... Help yourself.

727
00:45:01,266 --> 00:45:03,366
Thanks.

728
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,066
Is he okay?

729
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,333
- Hmm?
- The nightmares.

730
00:45:08,568 --> 00:45:10,866
I heard him last night.

731
00:45:10,899 --> 00:45:12,999
Um, he's sleeping now.

732
00:45:15,233 --> 00:45:18,266
How long have they
been going on?

733
00:45:19,699 --> 00:45:22,200
Uh, ever since he was eight.

734
00:45:23,899 --> 00:45:25,999
Um, he, uh, well...

735
00:45:27,366 --> 00:45:29,833
He told me...

736
00:45:29,866 --> 00:45:31,766
about that night
and what he saw.

737
00:45:31,799 --> 00:45:33,899
The assault.

738
00:45:34,534 --> 00:45:38,300
Whoa. He's never
told anyone that before.

739
00:45:40,266 --> 00:45:42,966
I'm so sorry for
what happened to you.

740
00:45:42,999 --> 00:45:46,866
I just hoped he'd forget
the whole thing.

741
00:45:49,367 --> 00:45:53,300
But the nightmares kicked in.

742
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,799
Sorry.

743
00:45:55,833 --> 00:45:58,100
And I took him to therapist
after therapist,

744
00:45:58,133 --> 00:46:00,300
but nothing seemed to help.

745
00:46:00,333 --> 00:46:04,799
And then he started
self-medicating with alcohol.

746
00:46:04,833 --> 00:46:06,933
But, um...

747
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:12,933
...he told me that
the nightmares went away

748
00:46:12,966 --> 00:46:14,966
when he started seeing you.

749
00:46:17,401 --> 00:46:19,699
I didn't know that.

750
00:46:23,166 --> 00:46:24,899
May I ask...

751
00:46:24,933 --> 00:46:27,300
why does your mum
hate him so much?

752
00:46:27,334 --> 00:46:29,732
Um, Hardin's your son...

753
00:46:30,334 --> 00:46:32,600
Yes, and I love him,

754
00:46:33,066 --> 00:46:36,300
but he is <i>not</i> without
his challenges.

755
00:46:36,334 --> 00:46:40,833
You can tell me.
What happened between you two?

756
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,200
He lied to me.

757
00:46:45,799 --> 00:46:48,367
- A big lie?
- A massive lie.

758
00:46:49,699 --> 00:46:51,799
Is he sorry?

759
00:46:53,699 --> 00:46:55,233
He is.

760
00:46:55,266 --> 00:46:58,766
What are you
two gabbing on about?

761
00:46:58,799 --> 00:47:00,799
Make sure you brush your teeth.

762
00:47:00,833 --> 00:47:03,899
He used to give me such a hard
time about brushing his teeth.

763
00:47:03,933 --> 00:47:05,632
Mum, for the love of God,

764
00:47:05,666 --> 00:47:07,301
of course I'm gonna
brush my teeth.

765
00:47:07,334 --> 00:47:09,401
Great. Morning!

766
00:47:09,434 --> 00:47:12,666
- Morning. Thank you.
- Kisses:

767
00:47:13,301 --> 00:47:15,367
I love your mom.

768
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:18,133
She's all right.

769
00:47:20,933 --> 00:47:23,033
Happy belated.

770
00:47:23,534 --> 00:47:25,999
But you already got me a gift.

771
00:47:26,033 --> 00:47:28,033
True, but you
had to snoop around

772
00:47:28,066 --> 00:47:29,999
and open it without me,
thus denying me

773
00:47:30,033 --> 00:47:32,999
the pleasure of watching
you react to said gift.

774
00:47:33,033 --> 00:47:35,133
Therefore...

775
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,301
"Tessa's perfect day."

776
00:47:39,833 --> 00:47:41,899
What's my perfect day?

777
00:47:41,933 --> 00:47:43,866
Well, that's for you to decide.

778
00:47:43,899 --> 00:47:46,066
Whatever your wish or desire,

779
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:50,899
I will agree to without
any snide remarks or tantrums.

780
00:47:50,933 --> 00:47:54,234
Your time starts in three,
two, one.

781
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,234
Isn't this nice?

782
00:47:58,267 --> 00:48:01,401
I always wanted
to go ice skating.

783
00:48:01,434 --> 00:48:04,133
Yeah, it's... great.
I'm loving...

784
00:48:04,166 --> 00:48:06,301
Unhh! Unh...

785
00:48:06,334 --> 00:48:08,367
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

786
00:48:08,401 --> 00:48:10,066
Just a tad rusty.

787
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,899
When was the last time
you skated?

788
00:48:11,933 --> 00:48:14,166
I've never skated before.

789
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,833
Do you want me
to get you a walker?

790
00:48:15,866 --> 00:48:18,033
You're doing great.

791
00:48:18,066 --> 00:48:20,301
Fuck no!

792
00:48:20,334 --> 00:48:24,066
Are you... Oh, it's okay.
It's... it's okay.

793
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,201
Whoo.

794
00:48:26,732 --> 00:48:29,033
- Are you okay?
- Yup.

795
00:48:29,367 --> 00:48:31,666
Do you want to stop?

796
00:48:31,899 --> 00:48:34,133
No. We're here to have...

797
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:38,066
Unhh! Aaah!

798
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:40,899
Hardin?
I have a better idea.

799
00:48:40,933 --> 00:48:43,267
Stretch out into Child's Pose,

800
00:48:43,301 --> 00:48:47,334
and let the day's
tension just melt away.

801
00:48:47,367 --> 00:48:49,899
It's not the pose
melting this tension away,

802
00:48:49,933 --> 00:48:51,933
- it's the fucking heat.
- Shh!

803
00:48:51,966 --> 00:48:54,666
- Is there any air-conditioning?
- It's hot yoga.

804
00:48:54,699 --> 00:48:57,732
From Child's Pose,
lift, and slowly press back

805
00:48:57,766 --> 00:49:00,799
into your Downward Facing Dog.

806
00:49:00,833 --> 00:49:02,267
Did anyone ever tell you

807
00:49:02,301 --> 00:49:04,899
you have the most amazing bum?

808
00:49:04,933 --> 00:49:06,666
Stop.

809
00:49:06,699 --> 00:49:09,666
...and slowly move into
<i>salamba sarvangasana.</i>

810
00:49:09,699 --> 00:49:12,201
Excuse me,
is this beginner's yoga?

811
00:49:12,234 --> 00:49:16,267
That was at ten-thirty.
This is acro-yoga.

812
00:49:17,933 --> 00:49:21,966
...and then lift
them up and towards the ceiling.

813
00:49:21,999 --> 00:49:24,100
Breathe together.

814
00:49:26,966 --> 00:49:30,100
Inhale, lift your arms overhead.

815
00:49:32,066 --> 00:49:34,833
And as you exhale,
lean forward.

816
00:49:34,866 --> 00:49:38,999
Allow your partner's
weight to lean into you.

817
00:49:39,033 --> 00:49:41,699
Slowly breathe and
open your legs and...

818
00:49:41,732 --> 00:49:43,833
wider... inhale...

819
00:49:45,234 --> 00:49:46,933
a little wider...

820
00:49:46,966 --> 00:49:50,732
and if you can,
put your legs even wider.

821
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,632
Is yoga supposed
to be a turn-on?

822
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:05,334
Are you turned on?

823
00:50:05,367 --> 00:50:06,899
Mm-hmm.

824
00:50:06,933 --> 00:50:08,866
- Can we leave then?
- Mm-hmm.

825
00:50:08,899 --> 00:50:11,999
- Now? Let's go.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

826
00:50:12,866 --> 00:50:14,966
Sweaty! I am sweaty!

827
00:50:15,267 --> 00:50:18,101
Wait! Just give me
five minutes, okay?

828
00:50:18,134 --> 00:50:20,966
I just need to get...

829
00:50:26,134 --> 00:50:28,234

Are you serious?

862
00:52:22,467 --> 00:52:25,234
Hi! Kimberly,
what's wrong?

863
00:52:27,201 --> 00:52:29,333
Oh, no. How can we help?

864
00:52:30,034 --> 00:52:31,167
Hmm.

865
00:52:31,201 --> 00:52:32,632
Hi.

866
00:52:32,666 --> 00:52:34,967
You have no idea
how much of a lifesaver

867
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,167
the two of you are right now.

868
00:52:36,201 --> 00:52:37,833
God, poor Vance caught this bug

869
00:52:37,866 --> 00:52:39,899
and he's throwing up everywhere.

870
00:52:39,933 --> 00:52:41,833
It's no problem.

871
00:52:41,866 --> 00:52:45,000
Okay, who are you and what
have you done with Hardin?

872
00:52:45,034 --> 00:52:47,632
It's part of my birthday present.
I'll tell you later.

873
00:52:47,666 --> 00:52:50,167
Ohh! I'm running so late.

874
00:52:50,201 --> 00:52:53,967
I'll be back in a few hours,
okay? You're in good hands.

875
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,866
- Bye.
- Thank you.

876
00:52:59,934 --> 00:53:02,034
Hi.

877
00:53:02,067 --> 00:53:06,034
Um, so, we have the
whole afternoon together.

878
00:53:06,067 --> 00:53:09,300
- Is there anything that you want to do?
- No.

879
00:53:09,333 --> 00:53:11,934
I could get us some markers
and we can draw!

880
00:53:11,967 --> 00:53:13,766
I don't like to draw.

881
00:53:13,799 --> 00:53:15,899
No? Are you hungry?

882
00:53:17,833 --> 00:53:19,934
No.

883
00:53:29,766 --> 00:53:32,799
Wanna tell me about your trains?

884
00:53:35,666 --> 00:53:37,866
Okay, I don't want
to hear about them anyway.

885
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:39,866
What are those marks
on your arm?

886
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:41,366
My tattoos.

887
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,134
- Why do you have them?
- Because I like them.

888
00:53:44,167 --> 00:53:45,866
Don't people think
it looks strange?

889
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:47,799
I don't give a fuck
what people think.

890
00:53:47,833 --> 00:53:49,934
Which people don't you
give a fuck about?

891
00:53:49,967 --> 00:53:52,233
- Oh, shit. Don't say fuck.
- Shit.

892
00:53:52,266 --> 00:53:54,034
Fuck. Shit.

893
00:53:54,067 --> 00:53:56,134
Fucky fuck. Shit...

894
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:59,067
- Hey. So...
- Hi!

895
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:01,321
He is actually hungry now.
We need to get him some...

896
00:54:01,333 --> 00:54:02,821
Fuck. Shit.

897
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:04,200
Uh, I can go if you want.

898
00:54:04,233 --> 00:54:05,967
- Or you could.
- No, it's fine.

899
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,900
- I'll get us some sandwiches.
- Perfect.

900
00:54:07,934 --> 00:54:10,266
- Thank you so much.
- Whoo! Okay!

901
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:11,654
- See you later. Bye-bye.
- Okay, bye!

902
00:54:11,666 --> 00:54:14,101
Shit. Fuck. Shit.

903
00:54:16,699 --> 00:54:18,799
Go ahead.

904
00:54:21,101 --> 00:54:23,699
Here,
I can take those now.

905
00:54:23,967 --> 00:54:26,333
You know, she really
brings out the best in you.

906
00:54:26,366 --> 00:54:28,867
Is it that obvious?

907
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,867
Have a nice holiday.

908
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,000
You too.

909
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,766
See ya, mate.

910
00:54:35,799 --> 00:54:37,900
See ya, mate.

911
00:54:44,366 --> 00:54:46,034
You ready?

912
00:54:46,067 --> 00:54:49,133
Yeah. Uh, we're
the last ones here,

913
00:54:49,166 --> 00:54:51,400
so I just have to set the alarm.

914
00:54:51,433 --> 00:54:53,732
Merry Christmas.

915
00:54:55,433 --> 00:54:58,034
Christmas is next week.

916
00:55:00,034 --> 00:55:03,800
I've never been one
to follow the rules.

917
00:55:10,133 --> 00:55:12,233
It says "Whatever our souls
are made of..."

918
00:55:12,266 --> 00:55:14,967
"His and mine are the same."

919
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,100
What's wrong?

920
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:30,166
I didn't think that I'd see you over the
holidays, so I didn't get you anything.

921
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:33,066
Is there anything that you want?

922
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:37,934
Another chance?

923
00:55:40,599 --> 00:55:43,266
Do you promise to act
like this every day?

924
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,599
No.

925
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:50,000
But I'll try.

926
00:55:57,767 --> 00:55:59,867
Whatever it takes.

927
00:56:27,266 --> 00:56:30,133
We can't do this here.
What if someone comes in?

928
00:56:30,166 --> 00:56:33,300
Helloooo?
Anyone here?

929
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,900
Anyone?!

930
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:40,700
You just have an answer
for everything, don't you?

931
00:56:53,999 --> 00:56:55,767
It's fake.

932
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,867
Shit.

933
00:58:25,366 --> 00:58:28,366
There's no one else
for me, Tessa.

934
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,700
No one.

935
00:58:34,733 --> 00:58:36,834
I love you.

936
00:58:37,133 --> 00:58:39,867
I love you too.

937
00:58:40,899 --> 00:58:46,100
Don't say "too." Sounds like
you're agreeing with me.

938
00:58:47,033 --> 00:58:49,133
I love you, Hardin.

939
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,999
<i>Trish.</i>

940
00:59:23,033 --> 00:59:24,200
Yeah, it's Ken.

941
00:59:24,233 --> 00:59:26,333
This is a surprise.

942
00:59:26,366 --> 00:59:29,600
So listen, um,
my wife Karen and I

943
00:59:30,866 --> 00:59:34,333
are having people over
for Christmas, and...

944
00:59:34,366 --> 00:59:37,899
we would love it if you and
Hardin and Tessa could join us.

945
00:59:37,933 --> 00:59:42,233
Well, I'm leaving for London
today, but, um...

946
00:59:42,266 --> 00:59:44,633
the flight's not
until this evening,

947
00:59:44,667 --> 00:59:46,800
so I think we can pop over.

948
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,400
It would mean the world to me.

949
00:59:48,433 --> 00:59:51,833
I guess we'll see you later,
then.

950
00:59:51,866 --> 00:59:54,166
Merry Christmas, Trish.

951
00:59:56,433 --> 00:59:57,933
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

952
00:59:57,966 --> 00:59:59,066
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

953
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:01,233
Oh! I'm so proud of you.

954
01:00:01,667 --> 01:00:03,966
Can't wait to meet her.

955
01:00:27,433 --> 01:00:29,733
This is his <i>house?</i>

956
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:33,133
- I told you.
- For fuck's sake,

957
01:00:33,166 --> 01:00:35,866
I didn't think it was <i>this</i> big.

958
01:00:35,899 --> 01:00:37,866
Mum, we don't have to do this.

959
01:00:37,899 --> 01:00:42,133
Look, the last time I saw
your dad was ten years ago.

960
01:00:42,166 --> 01:00:44,366
It's time. Come on.

961
01:00:48,733 --> 01:00:50,366
- Hi. Karen?
- Yes, hi.

962
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,799

of <i>Taming of the Shrew</i>

979
01:01:54,833 --> 01:01:56,354
with the head of
the English department.

980
01:01:56,366 --> 01:01:58,766
It's not a big deal.

01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:00,389

Well, I'm glad you stopped by.

996
01:02:52,133 --> 01:02:53,833
Me too.

997
01:02:53,866 --> 01:02:55,799
Dinner should be ready shortly.

998
01:02:55,833 --> 01:02:58,334
Okay, I hope everybody
has a hearty appetite.

999
01:02:58,367 --> 01:03:00,401
- Absolutely!
- Karen is a dynamite cook.

1000
01:03:00,434 --> 01:03:02,367
Yes, she is.

1001
01:03:02,401 --> 01:03:04,133
Where'd you go?

1002
01:03:04,166 --> 01:03:05,866
Just for a walk.

1003
01:03:05,899 --> 01:03:07,666
So Trish,
I hear that

1004
01:03:07,699 --> 01:03:09,088
this is your first time
in the States?

1005
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:11,066
- Yeah, it is.
- And how do you like it?

1006
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:13,200
There's a lot to see.

1007
01:03:13,233 --> 01:03:16,300
It's kind of worn out
its welcome, if you ask me.

1008
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:19,632
Be happy to get back home
once I graduate.

1009
01:03:19,666 --> 01:03:22,266
You're moving back to England
after graduation?

1010
01:03:22,301 --> 01:03:24,599
Yeah, of course I am.

1011
01:03:24,833 --> 01:03:27,699
Trish, can I get you
another glass before you leave us?

1012
01:03:27,732 --> 01:03:29,301
No. But it was lovely.
Thank you.

1013
01:03:29,334 --> 01:03:30,933
I'm so glad you like it.

1014
01:03:30,966 --> 01:03:32,699
We got it in Greece
on our honeymoon.

1015
01:03:32,732 --> 01:03:34,866
I stuck to Pellegrino.

1016
01:03:34,899 --> 01:03:38,033
We stayed in
this gorgeous villa.

1017
01:03:38,334 --> 01:03:41,666
Did you know that
the beaches in Santorini

1018
01:03:41,699 --> 01:03:43,833
are made up of volcanic pebbles,

1019
01:03:43,866 --> 01:03:46,999
so there's no sand
to make the water murky.

1020
01:03:47,033 --> 01:03:49,233
So it is a crystal-clear...

1021
01:03:49,266 --> 01:03:51,899
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Hardin.

1022
01:03:51,933 --> 01:03:54,166
- Excuse me?
- Look at your fucking trousers.

1023
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,799
I'm sorry, Mum,
but seriously,

1024
01:03:55,833 --> 01:03:57,632
do you have any sensitivity
whatsoever?

1025
01:03:57,666 --> 01:04:00,033
You're just boorishly droning on

1026
01:04:00,066 --> 01:04:02,133
with no regard for
the lives you destroyed.

1027
01:04:02,166 --> 01:04:05,866
P-Perhaps we could find
a more private place

1028
01:04:05,899 --> 01:04:08,966
- to have this conversation.
- By all means.

1029
01:04:08,999 --> 01:04:11,599
It's Bill Gates.

1030
01:04:13,033 --> 01:04:15,766
Okay, well, you are obviously
quite upset with me,

1031
01:04:15,799 --> 01:04:18,166
so go ahead and say
what's on your mind.

1032
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,066
Why did you even invite us here?

1033
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:22,033
I invited you here
because you're my family.

1034
01:04:22,066 --> 01:04:24,233
We're not your family.
We <i>were</i> your family.

1035
01:04:24,267 --> 01:04:26,921
- You ran out and reinvented...
- Hardin, I thought we were past this.

1036
01:04:26,933 --> 01:04:29,401
We didn't get past it. How were
we supposed to get past it?

1037
01:04:29,434 --> 01:04:31,899
You haven't owned up
to anything!

1038
01:04:31,933 --> 01:04:34,033
Your twelve steps...
making amends.

1039
01:04:34,066 --> 01:04:36,966
Where's Mum's amends?
Mum, have you got your amends yet?

1040
01:04:36,999 --> 01:04:38,666
What would you like me to do?

1041
01:04:38,699 --> 01:04:40,088
You don't think that
I am consumed by guilt?

1042
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:42,699
I knew that night
that I had to go.

1043
01:04:42,732 --> 01:04:44,899
No! After that night
you had to <i>stay!</i>

1044
01:04:44,933 --> 01:04:47,166
And you didn't!
That night happened <i>because</i> of you!

1045
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,632
Yes! And I have been haunted
by it for the last ten years!

1046
01:04:49,666 --> 01:04:52,133
It haunts you?!
I fucking watched it happen,

1047
01:04:52,166 --> 01:04:55,033
you bastard!

1048
01:05:00,334 --> 01:05:02,666
I'm sorry, Mum.

1049
01:05:02,699 --> 01:05:04,766
I <i>had</i> to.

1050
01:05:05,334 --> 01:05:08,866
No, wait. You don't have to get an Uber.
I can give you a ride.

1051
01:05:08,899 --> 01:05:11,201
After the shit
you've just pulled?

1052
01:05:11,234 --> 01:05:13,899
Not to mention you're drunk.

1053
01:05:13,933 --> 01:05:15,999
Look, I'm sorry
I'm not like you.

1054
01:05:16,033 --> 01:05:18,899
You may be able to forget
everything he did, but I can't.

1055
01:05:18,933 --> 01:05:21,334
I haven't forgotten anything.

1056
01:05:21,367 --> 01:05:25,866
I've <i>chosen</i> to forgive him
so that <i>I</i> can move on.

1057
01:05:26,766 --> 01:05:30,401
Hardin, resentments like this
are gonna destroy you.

1058
01:05:30,434 --> 01:05:35,133
And they're gonna take Tessa
right down with you.

Oh.

1084
01:07:32,301 --> 01:07:36,400
And I thought I was the only Grinch
who worked the day after Christmas.

1085
01:07:36,433 --> 01:07:39,167
We have gotta stop
meeting like this.

1086
01:07:39,201 --> 01:07:43,267
You're right. I'll have restraining
orders drafted immediately.

1087
01:07:43,301 --> 01:07:44,999
How was your Christmas?

1088
01:07:45,033 --> 01:07:47,134
Uneventful. Yours?

1089
01:07:47,899 --> 01:07:49,999
Eventful.

1090
01:07:50,234 --> 01:07:52,833
That's a loaded response.

1091
01:07:55,366 --> 01:07:58,167
Well, I'd love to hear more
about your eventful Christmas,

1092
01:07:58,201 --> 01:07:59,966
so... lunch?

1093
01:07:59,999 --> 01:08:01,301
Postmates. I'm buying.

1094
01:08:01,333 --> 01:08:03,301
How could I refuse?

1095
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:05,933
Great. I'll email you
some menus.

1096
01:08:05,966 --> 01:08:08,833
I know,
very chivalrous of me.

1097
01:08:12,333 --> 01:08:17,101
I thought that things were
getting better, but...

1098
01:08:17,134 --> 01:08:21,034
it's clear that he still has a
lot of stuff he has to deal with.

1099
01:08:21,067 --> 01:08:24,201
And I just feel
really bad for him...

1100
01:08:24,234 --> 01:08:26,833
and I don't know how to fix it.

1101
01:08:26,866 --> 01:08:29,167
Well, let me ask you this.

1102
01:08:30,201 --> 01:08:32,632
Are you in love with him?

1103
01:08:33,366 --> 01:08:36,899
- I am.
- Then you got yourself a problem.

1104
01:08:38,933 --> 01:08:40,766
Those are your words of wisdom?

1105
01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:43,167
Hey, I never said I had
any words of wisdom.

1106
01:08:43,201 --> 01:08:48,699
No, you just wanted to know
whether I actually loved him.

1107
01:08:48,732 --> 01:08:51,034
I should get back to work.

1108
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:55,101
Thank you for lunch.
Next time it's on me.

1109
01:08:55,134 --> 01:08:58,400
I don't think there's
gonna be a next time.

1110
01:08:58,433 --> 01:08:59,933
Ouch.

1111
01:08:59,967 --> 01:09:02,666
No, not like that,
believe me.

1112
01:09:02,699 --> 01:09:04,366
I'm moving to Seattle.

1113
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:07,300
Vance offered me the Head of
Finance position at the new office.

1114
01:09:07,333 --> 01:09:09,201
Oh, my God.
Trevor, that's amazing.

1115
01:09:09,234 --> 01:09:11,167
Thanks.

1116
01:09:11,201 --> 01:09:13,333
Well, ya know,
I don't leave tomorrow.

1117
01:09:13,366 --> 01:09:15,134
We could still... that's...

1118
01:09:15,167 --> 01:09:17,933
No, that's stupid.

1119
01:09:26,134 --> 01:09:28,233
Tessa.

1120
01:09:28,934 --> 01:09:34,366
My sister has struggled
with addiction her whole life.

1121
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:36,666
This thing between
you and Hardin...

1122
01:09:36,699 --> 01:09:38,934
it's not gonna end well.

1123
01:09:42,433 --> 01:09:44,732
Well, you're wrong.

1124
01:10:21,934 --> 01:10:24,333
This one's better anyway.

1125
01:10:37,266 --> 01:10:41,300
You're never gonna show me what
you're writing in there, are you?

1126
01:10:41,333 --> 01:10:43,632
Maybe... someday.

1127
01:10:51,067 --> 01:10:53,000
You don't wanna see who that is?

1128
01:10:53,034 --> 01:10:55,134
I know who it is.

1129
01:10:55,166 --> 01:10:56,766
It's Steph.

1130
01:10:56,799 --> 01:11:01,000
The frat house is having
a New Year's Eve party.

1131
01:11:01,034 --> 01:11:03,133
Right.

1132
01:11:03,366 --> 01:11:05,034
Do you wanna go?

1133
01:11:05,067 --> 01:11:08,732
No. I don't wanna
leave you here alone.

1134
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:11,732
I wouldn't be alone.

1135
01:11:11,766 --> 01:11:13,867
I'd go with you.

1136
01:11:15,067 --> 01:11:18,200
Sorry, I... I just thought
after everything that happened

1137
01:11:18,233 --> 01:11:20,089
- that you wouldn't want to...
- I'm not scared of them.

1138
01:11:20,101 --> 01:11:22,266
Besides, if it
blows up in my face,

1139
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:25,632
then we can just
stay in next year.

1140
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:37,200
What was that for?

1141
01:11:40,034 --> 01:11:43,632
I just loved
how you said "next year."

1142
01:11:49,366 --> 01:11:50,900
Hello?

1143
01:11:50,934 --> 01:11:52,334
Tessa, why aren't you
in the office?

1144
01:11:52,366 --> 01:11:54,034
Well, yeah, I...
I thought it was...

1145
01:11:54,067 --> 01:11:55,400
I'm kidding.
Happy New Year.

1146
01:11:55,433 --> 01:11:57,867
Yes!

1147
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:59,632
You got me.

1148
01:11:59,666 --> 01:12:01,300
<i>I'll cut to the chase.</i>

1149
01:12:01,333 --> 01:12:03,266
We went with the manuscript
you recommended,

1150
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:05,333
and it sold today
in quite a bidding war.

1151
01:12:05,366 --> 01:12:08,233
Wow, that's... that's fantastic.

1152
01:12:08,266 --> 01:12:10,034
<i>Listen, we were
gonna hire someone</i>

1153
01:12:10,066 --> 01:12:11,786
<i>to do digital submissions
in Seattle, but...</i>

1154
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:14,200
you're better than anyone
I've interviewed.

1155
01:12:14,233 --> 01:12:16,654
<i>I'll take care of your tuition,
living expenses, provided you transfer.</i>

1156
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:20,333
Obviously, Hardin's welcome
to join you.

1157
01:12:20,366 --> 01:12:21,666
Wow, that...

1158
01:12:21,699 --> 01:12:24,666
uh, that sounds really amazing.

1159
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:29,133
Um, can you give me a chance
to think about it, please?

1160
01:12:29,166 --> 01:12:30,767
<i>Of course. I just wanted</i>

1161
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,133
to share the good news.

1162
01:12:32,166 --> 01:12:34,034
Happy New Year, Tess.

1163
01:12:34,066 --> 01:12:36,166
Happy New Year, sir.

1164
01:12:38,967 --> 01:12:40,300
Hey.

1165
01:12:40,333 --> 01:12:42,333
Were you talking to me?

1166
01:12:42,366 --> 01:12:43,834
Nope.

1167
01:12:43,867 --> 01:12:46,100
What is taking so long?

1168
01:12:46,133 --> 01:12:47,834
Being a woman.

1169
01:12:47,867 --> 01:12:50,100
Now, can you go wait outside?

1170
01:12:50,133 --> 01:12:52,233
- So sorry.
- Thanks.

1171
01:13:02,066 --> 01:13:04,166
Undefeated!

1172
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,366
Fuck!

1173
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:09,100
- It's okay.
- Sorry. Sorry.

1174
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:13,400
We've missed you.

1175
01:13:13,433 --> 01:13:14,699
Are we good?

1176
01:13:14,733 --> 01:13:16,400
Ancient history.

1177
01:13:16,433 --> 01:13:17,967
You guys wanna get in on this?

1178
01:13:17,999 --> 01:13:19,233
Yeah, you can take my place.

1179
01:13:19,266 --> 01:13:21,366
Go. I'll watch.

1180
01:13:22,333 --> 01:13:23,934
I like to watch.

1181
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:26,133
Yeah, I bet you do.

1182
01:13:26,166 --> 01:13:28,233
Okay, sure.

1183
01:13:28,533 --> 01:13:30,033
You know what you're doing,
right?

1184
01:13:30,066 --> 01:13:32,100
- Not a clue.
- Awesome.

1185
01:13:32,133 --> 01:13:34,233
Great.

1186
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:38,599
Steph, Tristan: Tessa!

1187
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:41,133
Mmm.

1188
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:42,300
Mm.

1189
01:13:42,333 --> 01:13:43,666
What is that?

1190
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:45,266
Cherry vodka sour.

1191
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:47,599
Cool.

1192
01:13:51,767 --> 01:13:53,867
This is fun!

1193
01:13:58,834 --> 01:14:00,934
- Yes!
- Yes!

1194
01:14:06,266 --> 01:14:09,266
Drink, bitch!

1195
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:11,366
Whoo! I like this!

1196
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:14,200
- Nice job! One more!
- Aowww!

1197
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:25,599
I... suck at this.

1198
01:14:26,867 --> 01:14:28,966
Jamie. Hey.

1199
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:33,667
- It <i>is</i> you.
- Hi.

1200
01:14:34,033 --> 01:14:35,900
Can I talk to you upstairs?

1201
01:14:35,933 --> 01:14:38,033
Lead the way.

1202
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:53,999
Molly's here!

1203
01:14:55,333 --> 01:14:57,633
You fucking kidding me?

1204
01:14:59,266 --> 01:15:01,366
Fuck this.

1205
01:15:04,999 --> 01:15:07,300
So cool,
all those gears.

1206
01:15:07,767 --> 01:15:09,767
You're like a robot.

1207
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:11,200
Who says I'm not?

1208
01:15:11,233 --> 01:15:13,867
I have a tattoo
of a little butterfly,

1209
01:15:13,899 --> 01:15:16,767
but you can only see it
when I'm naked.

1210
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,867
- I love butterflies.
- Really?

1211
01:15:18,899 --> 01:15:20,966
Yeah.

1212
01:15:26,999 --> 01:15:29,767
Hey!
I was looking for you.

1213
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,899
Hey. Let's leave.

1214
01:15:32,266 --> 01:15:34,366
Okay.

1215
01:15:38,999 --> 01:15:43,133
Aww. If it isn't the cute
couple together again.

1216
01:15:43,166 --> 01:15:45,300
Oh, yay. It's Molly.

1217
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:47,133
- Where you guys going?
- We're going home.

1218
01:15:47,166 --> 01:15:50,066
Ohh. Lame. Come on,
it's almost New Year's.

1219
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:52,899
- We just wanna be alone.
- Let's go.

1220
01:15:52,933 --> 01:15:56,633
Good. She never really
fit in, anyway.

1221
01:15:57,999 --> 01:15:59,333
One drink.

1222
01:15:59,366 --> 01:16:01,700
What... Tess.

1223
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:12,066
Excuse me, lovebirds,
you're on my chair.

1224
01:16:12,366 --> 01:16:14,800
- Seriously?
- Yeah. Now, fuck off.

1225
01:16:14,833 --> 01:16:16,100
Move.

1226
01:16:16,133 --> 01:16:18,233
Bitch.

1227
01:16:24,933 --> 01:16:27,233
Yes, I am <i>druuuunk!</i>

1228
01:16:28,899 --> 01:16:31,088
Would anybody like some weed brownies?
I made 'em myself.

1229
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:33,200
- No.
- Oh, I'm good.

1230
01:16:33,866 --> 01:16:36,266
Well, this is fun.
Can we leave?

1231
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:37,667
We should play a game.

1232
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:38,966
Like what, Scrabble?

1233
01:16:38,999 --> 01:16:40,799
How about...

1234
01:16:40,833 --> 01:16:43,133
- Truth or Dare?
- Jesus Christ.

1235
01:16:43,166 --> 01:16:45,200
- Why is that bad?
- Long story.

1236
01:16:45,233 --> 01:16:47,700
- Why would you say that?
- Because.

1237
01:16:47,733 --> 01:16:51,233
What's the matter, Hardin?
Scared of a little Truth or Dare?

1238
01:16:51,266 --> 01:16:53,366
Fuck you, Molly.

1239
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:54,933
I'll go first.

1240
01:16:54,966 --> 01:16:56,999
Hey, Tess, truth or dare?

1241
01:16:57,033 --> 01:16:58,700
Truth.

1242
01:16:58,733 --> 01:17:00,233
Uh, are you a virgin?

1243
01:17:00,266 --> 01:17:01,933
Molly, don't.

1244
01:17:01,966 --> 01:17:04,166
Oh. Duh. I already know
the answer to that,

1245
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:05,833
because Hardin fucked you.

1246
01:17:05,866 --> 01:17:07,899
Yes, he did.

1247
01:17:07,933 --> 01:17:10,300
My turn. Molly,
truth or dare?

1248
01:17:10,333 --> 01:17:12,633
Hmm, truth.

1249
01:17:14,733 --> 01:17:16,633
Is it true that you're a whore?

1250
01:17:16,667 --> 01:17:18,233
Oh, shit.

1251
01:17:18,266 --> 01:17:20,633
What the fuck did
you just call me?

1252
01:17:20,667 --> 01:17:23,766
I didn't call you anything.
I just asked you a question.

1253
01:17:23,799 --> 01:17:25,667
Are you a whore?

1254
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:27,733
- You are.
- You have to answer honestly,

1255
01:17:27,766 --> 01:17:30,733
because it's called
Truth for a reason.

1256
01:17:30,766 --> 01:17:32,899
No.

1257
01:17:32,933 --> 01:17:34,133
Do they not like each other?

1258
01:17:34,166 --> 01:17:35,733
Hey, Tess,
my turn again.

1259
01:17:35,766 --> 01:17:37,333
- Truth or dare?
- Truth.

1260
01:17:37,366 --> 01:17:38,899
Is it true that
you're a dumb-ass

1261
01:17:38,933 --> 01:17:40,766
for getting back together
with Hardin

1262
01:17:40,799 --> 01:17:42,833
after he clearly fucked you
for a bet?

1263
01:17:42,866 --> 01:17:44,966
Let's go.

1264
01:17:45,266 --> 01:17:46,766
No, that's not true.

1265
01:17:46,799 --> 01:17:48,899
Oh... but it is.

1266
01:17:48,933 --> 01:17:50,966
You believe anything
that comes out of his mouth.

1267
01:17:50,999 --> 01:17:52,766
I fucking hate you, Molly.

1268
01:17:52,799 --> 01:17:54,200
Which I don't blame you,

1269
01:17:54,233 --> 01:17:56,933
because, oh, man,
what that mouth can do.

1270
01:17:56,966 --> 01:17:59,066
And that tongue...

1271
01:18:09,999 --> 01:18:12,100
Get away from me!

1272
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:18,667
- You, like that, whore!
- Ohh!

1273
01:18:28,033 --> 01:18:30,100
Tessa, relax!

1274
01:18:30,799 --> 01:18:31,799
Awww...

1275
01:18:34,833 --> 01:18:36,366
You're a <i>whore!</i>

1276
01:18:36,401 --> 01:18:38,333
Get that fuckin' bitch
out of here!

1277
01:18:38,366 --> 01:18:40,300
Happy new year, bitch!

1278
01:18:40,333 --> 01:18:41,866
Fuck you, Tessa!

1279
01:18:41,899 --> 01:18:43,999
Get off me!

1280
01:18:44,333 --> 01:18:46,266
And you, move the fuck
out of my way!

1281
01:18:52,732 --> 01:18:56,200
- ...UFC or some..
- UFC?

1282
01:18:57,866 --> 01:19:00,166
I needed that.

1283
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:02,300
I'll bet you did.

1284
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:04,666

- Your phone.

Hardin?

1318

Hey, you!

1319
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:23,234
- Happy New Year.
- Hey.

1320
01:21:23,933 --> 01:21:25,401
I'm really glad we did that.

1321
01:21:25,434 --> 01:21:27,033
Me too.

1322
01:21:27,066 --> 01:21:28,833
Do me a favor and just
keep it between us?

1323
01:21:28,866 --> 01:21:31,699
Of course.
I never kiss and tell.

1324
01:21:31,732 --> 01:21:33,833
Thank you.

1325
01:21:34,732 --> 01:21:36,301
Uh-oh.

Tessa, wait!

1328
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:45,066
- Hey. Hey!
- Just hear me out.

1329
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:46,999
What the fuck?!

1330
01:21:47,033 --> 01:21:48,966
- Dude, she kissed <i>me.</i>
- Fuck off!

1331
01:21:48,999 --> 01:21:52,033
Tessa, what the fuck!
How can you do that?!

1332
01:21:52,066 --> 01:21:54,301
Why do you care, huh?
You just kissed that girl.

1333
01:21:54,334 --> 01:21:56,100
No, no, no,
you don't get to cry!

1334
01:21:56,133 --> 01:21:58,401
You just fucking kissed a guy
right in front of me!

1335
01:21:58,434 --> 01:22:00,401
- And what did you do, huh?
- Nothing!

1336
01:22:00,434 --> 01:22:02,301
- The fuck is wrong with you?!
- She just said

1337
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:05,799
that she doesn't kiss and tell,
you fucking liar!

1338
01:22:05,833 --> 01:22:07,732
It's a figure of speech!

1339
01:22:07,766 --> 01:22:09,866
You should know I would
never fucking cheat on you!

1340
01:22:09,899 --> 01:22:14,201
Were you with her tonight? Is she who
you disappeared with the whole night?!

1341
01:22:14,234 --> 01:22:16,167
Yes!

1342
01:22:16,201 --> 01:22:18,732
- I was trying to make her forgive me.
- For what?!

1343
01:22:18,766 --> 01:22:23,267
Because I'm trying to be a better
person for you! That's all I fucking do!

1344
01:22:23,301 --> 01:22:26,732
Tell me what else I can do to
make you believe that I love you.

1345
01:22:26,766 --> 01:22:28,799
Tell me!

1346
01:22:28,833 --> 01:22:30,899
You're never gonna trust me.

1347
01:22:30,933 --> 01:22:32,732
Trust you?

1348
01:22:32,766 --> 01:22:34,133
You think that
I should trust you.

1349
01:22:34,167 --> 01:22:35,234
Yes!

1350
01:22:35,267 --> 01:22:38,100
Where has that ever gotten me?

1351
01:22:38,732 --> 01:22:41,766
You're never gonna
forgive me, are you?

1352
01:22:41,799 --> 01:22:44,167
You're just gonna keep bringing it
up, every time.

1353
01:22:44,201 --> 01:22:46,799
Because I don't trust you!

1354
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:50,367
You act like
you're so fucking innocent.

1399
01:26:02,967 --> 01:26:04,833
Tessa?

1400
01:26:04,866 --> 01:26:06,967
<i>What do you want, Hardin?</i>

1401
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,233
Trevor?

1402
01:26:09,266 --> 01:26:13,167
- Trevor, what the fuck are you doing with Tessa's phone?
- I'm with her now.

1403
01:26:13,201 --> 01:26:15,300
- Let me talk to her.
- That's not gonna happen.

1404
01:26:15,333 --> 01:26:17,067
Trevor, I'm not
fucking playing with you!

1405
01:26:17,101 --> 01:26:19,632
Shut the fuck up
and listen to me.

1406
01:26:19,666 --> 01:26:22,766
You're toxic and
you're bad news.

1407
01:26:22,799 --> 01:26:25,866
If you love Tessa, and I
think that you do, let her go.

1408
01:26:25,899 --> 01:26:27,233
Trevor, I just
wanna talk to her.

1409
01:26:27,266 --> 01:26:29,366
Please. Please.

1410
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,766
Trevor, please,
just let me talk to her.

1411
01:26:32,799 --> 01:26:34,799
Give her a chance to find
happiness in this life,

1412
01:26:34,833 --> 01:26:38,134
'cause she's never
gonna find it with you.

1413
01:26:38,167 --> 01:26:39,699
Here you go, hon.

1414
01:26:39,732 --> 01:26:43,200
Hey, good news.
Vance's company policy

1415
01:26:43,233 --> 01:26:45,900
is going to put your hospital

01:26:45,934 --> 01:26:48,034

How are the applications going?

1474
01:30:00,166 --> 01:30:03,300
Fine. Dad said
he'd make some calls.

1475
01:30:04,834 --> 01:30:07,033
You two spoke?

1476
01:30:07,066 --> 01:30:09,166
How'd that go?

1477
01:30:10,733 --> 01:30:12,834
As well as it could.

1478
01:30:14,133 --> 01:30:16,366
Hardin, what happened
that night,

1479
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,066
it wasn't his fault.

1480
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:20,333
And all the other nights?

1481
01:30:20,366 --> 01:30:22,666
Not his fault?

1482
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:26,300
Yeah, it was shit.

1483
01:30:26,599 --> 01:30:29,700
It was shit, and we both
deserved better.

1484
01:30:29,733 --> 01:30:31,266
But the only person
you're punishing

1485
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:33,033
by not forgiving him
is yourself.

1486
01:30:33,066 --> 01:30:37,767
And Hardin, I want you
to stop punishing yourself.

1487
01:30:38,632 --> 01:30:40,800
So you think it's fair
that he gets to live in

1488
01:30:40,834 --> 01:30:44,400
that big, fancy house,
and you're here all alone?

1489
01:30:44,433 --> 01:30:46,700
Who said I was alone?

1490
01:30:46,733 --> 01:30:49,066
What?
You're seeing someone?

1491
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:53,200
- You don't have to sound so surprised.
- Who?

1492
01:30:53,533 --> 01:30:55,834
- Mike.
- Mike?

1493
01:30:56,133 --> 01:30:58,900
- Wanker-from-next-door Mike?
- He's <i>not</i> a wanker!

1494
01:30:58,934 --> 01:31:01,667
- He is a bit of a wanker.
- He's a really nice man,

1495
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:03,667
and he treats me well.

1496
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:05,999
Yeah, he fucking better.

1497
01:31:06,767 --> 01:31:10,200
Did you hear that Vance
was moving to Seattle?

1498
01:31:10,233 --> 01:31:12,767
Tessa's going too.
How did you know?

1499
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,800
Well, we talk from time to time.

1500
01:31:14,834 --> 01:31:17,066
He's having a going-away
party on Sunday,

1501
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:20,733
and I think you should get your
ass off this sofa and go get her.

1502
01:31:20,767 --> 01:31:25,033
- No, I can't.
- Can't? Or you don't want to face what you left behind?

1503
01:31:25,066 --> 01:31:26,333
I'd have to leave right now.

1504
01:31:26,366 --> 01:31:28,767
So what are you waiting for?

1505
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:31,366
- Mum, I'm not gonna...
- Hardin...

1506
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:37,733
I love you, but you <i>have</i> to start
fighting for what really matters.

1507
01:31:47,667 --> 01:31:49,366
<i>Thank you all
so much for coming.</i>

1508
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:53,633
It means the world to me to have
everyone I love here with us.

1509
01:31:53,667 --> 01:31:55,767
I am... beyond proud

1510
01:31:56,066 --> 01:31:57,999
of the work that everyone
in this room has done,

1511
01:31:58,033 --> 01:31:59,999
but there is one
particular person

1512
01:32:00,033 --> 01:32:02,233
I could not have done
any of this without.

1513
01:32:02,266 --> 01:32:03,700
And that's Kimberly.

1514
01:32:09,333 --> 01:32:11,300
Smith and I were talking
the other day,

1515
01:32:11,333 --> 01:32:13,354
and he said, "Dad,
going-away parties are kind of sad."

1516
01:32:13,366 --> 01:32:15,300
And he's got a point.

1517
01:32:15,333 --> 01:32:17,899
And we were like,
"How do we make this a celebration?"

1518
01:32:17,933 --> 01:32:19,999
Then we got an idea.

1519
01:32:24,866 --> 01:32:27,999
Kimberly...

1520
01:32:28,899 --> 01:32:31,966
will you marry my dad
and be my stepmom?

1521
01:32:31,999 --> 01:32:34,100
Aww...

1522
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:37,300
Yes!

1523
01:32:37,333 --> 01:32:39,200
Yes!

1524
01:32:43,233 --> 01:32:44,833
What about me?

1525
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:49,733
- Aww...
- Yay!

1526
01:33:00,966 --> 01:33:02,733
Who said happy endings
don't exist?

1527
01:33:02,767 --> 01:33:04,333
Don't tell me.
You're the cynic.

1528
01:33:04,366 --> 01:33:07,233
I'm turning over a new leaf.

1529
01:33:07,266 --> 01:33:10,200
You look very pretty,
by the way.

1530
01:33:10,233 --> 01:33:14,733
So... have you made up
your mind about Seattle?

1531
01:33:14,966 --> 01:33:17,366
Well, I don't see
much of a reason

1532
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:20,899
to pass up the opportunity
anymore.

1533
01:33:22,233 --> 01:33:23,700
That's...

1534
01:33:23,733 --> 01:33:24,733
really nice to hear.

1535
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,233
Look, Tessa,
there's something

1536
01:33:28,266 --> 01:33:30,266
I actually want
to get off my chest.

1537
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:32,600
Okay.

1538
01:33:32,866 --> 01:33:36,233
Uh, the other day,
in the hospital...

1539
01:33:36,266 --> 01:33:38,133
I answered your cell phone,

1540
01:33:38,166 --> 01:33:39,966
it was Hardin,

1541
01:33:39,999 --> 01:33:43,200
and I told him
to stay away from you.

1542
01:33:43,233 --> 01:33:45,100
- What?
- In retrospect,

1543
01:33:45,133 --> 01:33:47,766
I do realize that
that was over the line,

1544
01:33:47,799 --> 01:33:51,733
and I do realize that I let my
emotions get the best of me,

1545
01:33:51,766 --> 01:33:53,866
and I'm sorry,

1546
01:33:53,899 --> 01:33:58,033
but somehow you bring
that side out of me, so...

1547
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:01,600
Okay.

1548
01:34:03,233 --> 01:34:05,033
Are you okay?

1549
01:34:05,066 --> 01:34:06,933
Eh.

1550
01:34:06,966 --> 01:34:09,133
There's actually
more I'd like to say,

1551
01:34:09,166 --> 01:34:10,954
- but would you excuse me for a second?
- Yeah.

1552
01:34:10,966 --> 01:34:13,066
Thanks.

1553
01:34:35,033 --> 01:34:37,133
I'm so sorry.

1554
01:34:48,799 --> 01:34:50,899
Shit.

1555
01:34:54,732 --> 01:34:56,066
She left from the front.

1556
01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:58,200
Thank you.

1557
01:35:02,699 --> 01:35:04,799
Tessa!

1558
01:35:18,366 --> 01:35:22,966
You're just never gonna
leave me alone, are you?

1559
01:35:45,966 --> 01:35:48,066

O-kay,

1572
01:36:50,334 --> 01:36:53,066
So... hey, so <i>I</i> was dreamin'
of a white Christmas.

1573
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:54,966
Hmph! All I got was heat.

1574
01:36:54,999 --> 01:36:57,401
You know, I hate the heat.

1575
01:36:57,434 --> 01:36:59,833
Heat get into people's minds

1576
01:36:59,866 --> 01:37:02,799
and make them do
some crazy things.

01:37:18,966 --> 01:37:22,267

<i>And who knows?</i>

1584
01:37:38,966 --> 01:37:42,699
<i>Maybe there is a happy ending
for us after all.</i>

1585
01:37:42,732 --> 01:37:44,133
Tess.

1586
01:37:44,166 --> 01:37:46,666

Tessa.
Tessa.

1618
01:39:33,966 --> 01:39:35,100
Tessa.

1619
01:39:35,134 --> 01:39:36,899
Do you like to go on dates?

1620
01:39:36,933 --> 01:39:38,234
Because I don't.

1621
01:39:38,267 --> 01:39:40,766
But I-I will... with you.

1622
01:39:41,699 --> 01:39:43,201
If you wanna go.

1623
01:39:44,899 --> 01:39:45,899
Tessa.

1624
01:39:45,933 --> 01:39:47,899
That's so creepy.

1625
01:39:47,933 --> 01:39:49,921
I've been meaning to tell you
something for a long time,

1626
01:39:49,933 --> 01:39:52,167
and the reason
that I haven't told you

1627
01:39:52,201 --> 01:39:54,632
is because of Human Resources
in the workplace.

1628
01:39:54,666 --> 01:39:56,201
Don't talk about
Human Resources.

1629
01:39:56,234 --> 01:39:57,999
That's not... sexy.

1630
01:39:58,033 --> 01:39:59,367
Tessa!

1631
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:01,101
Don't do the finger.

1632
01:40:01,134 --> 01:40:02,267
Put it <i>down!</i>

1633
01:40:02,301 --> 01:40:04,632
I only pull out my teal suit

1634
01:40:04,666 --> 01:40:06,732
when I have something
important to say.

1635
01:40:06,766 --> 01:40:08,400
Occupied.

1636
01:40:08,433 --> 01:40:10,632
Tessa.

1637
01:40:10,666 --> 01:40:12,334
There's other bathrooms
in the house

1638
01:40:12,367 --> 01:40:15,066
if you need to go that badly.

1639
01:40:16,367 --> 01:40:18,833
Just go.

1640
01:40:18,866 --> 01:40:20,966
Yes. You can go now.
